The above is subject to the special standards whereby the shortfall in the policy reserve is assumed by the employer.</p>

</h6>
<div class="collapseable">
<p class="absatz "><sup>1</sup> Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, all guarantees in accordance with PUBLICA’s opening balance sheet, whereby the Confederation assumed the shortfall in the policy reserve in certain cases, are abrogated with retroactive effect. The cases in question are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>if PUBLICA cannot recover by court order the claims against affiliated organisations on the retirement of female members of the entry generation in accordance with Article 74 of the Ordinance of 25 April 2001<sup><a href="#fn-d7e629" id="fnbck-d7e629">16</a></sup> on Insurance in the Core Plan of the Federal Pension Fund;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>if the new rules for voluntary early retirement cannot be implemented on 1 January 2005: until their effective date, but no later than the expiry of any transition period that may have been set;</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>if there is a legally binding court ruling against PUBLICA or the Confederation, in the case of a claim to pension benefits that originated prior to migration, specifically in the case of legal proceedings underway at the time of migration.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="absatz "><sup>2</sup> The guarantee provided by the Confederation within the meaning of paragraph 1, letter c remains applicable in the case of legal proceedings of particular financial consequence. These are rulings that, due to their nature of precedence, require the adaptation of additional insurance conditions and which, by virtue of the amount of the shortfall in policy reserves or the administrative effort generated for PUBLICA in adapting the insurance conditions, entail extraordinarily high costs.</p>

<p class="absatz "><sup>1</sup> The Confederation pays PUBLICA, in the form of a lump-sum payment, the amount needed to cover the additional policy reserve requirements resulting from the lowering of the technical interest rate under paragraph 3 applicable to the portfolio of pensioners defined in paragraph 2 on the day on which this Act comes into force.</p>
<p class="absatz "><sup>2</sup> The portfolio of pensioners encompasses the recipients of old-age, invalidity and survivors’ pensions whose annuities started before the effective date of this Act, including those pensioners who remained with the Federal Pension Fund after their employer exited before 1 June 2003 (closed portfolios of pensioners).</p>

<p class="absatz "><sup>4</sup> The amount owed by the Confederation under paragraph 1 is reduced by the amount of the provision formed by PUBLICA for the closed portfolios of pensioners.</p>
<p class="absatz "><sup>5</sup> PUBLICA distributes the Confederation’s lump-sum payment among the individual employee pension funds, taking account of the different technical interest rates (paragraph 3) and <i>pro rata</i> to the policy reserve of their portfolio of old-age, invalidity and survivor pensioners.</p>
