<p><sup>3</sup> The risk assessments cover the following security objectives:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>the accuracy of the result;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>preserving voting secrecy and excluding premature partial results;</dd>

</h6>
<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> It must be possible to detect any manipulation that leads to a falsification of the result while preserving voting secrecy (complete verifiability). This is considered to be the case if requirements for individual and universal verifiability are met. </p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The requirements for individual verifiability are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>The person voting is given the opportunity to ascertain whether the vote as entered on the user device has been manipulated or intercepted on the user device or during transmission; to this end, the person voting receives proof that the trustworthy part of the system (Art. 8) has registered the vote as it was entered by the person voting on the user device as being in conformity with the system; proof of correct registration is provided for each partial vote.</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>A voter who has not cast his or her vote electronically can request proof after the electronic voting system is closed and within the statutory appeal deadlines that the trustworthy part of the system has not registered any vote cast using the client-side authentication credential of the voter.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>3</sup> The requirements for universal verifiability are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>The auditors receive proof that the result has been established correctly; the proof confirms that the result ascertained includes the following votes:<dl>
<dt>1. </dt>
<dd>all votes cast in conformity with the system that have been registered by the trustworthy part of the system;</dd>
<dt>2. </dt>
<dd>only votes cast in conformity with the system;</dd>
<dt>3. </dt>
<dd>all partial votes in accordance with the proof generated in the individual verification process.</dd>

<dt>2.3.1 </dt>
<dd>The cryptographic protocol must provide protection against an attacker attempting to tamper with the votes and the result, to breach voting secrecy or to obtain premature partial results (Nos 2.5–2.8). </dd>
<dt>2.3.2 </dt>
<dd>The assumption must be made that an attacker has the following abilities:<dl>

<dd>He can read or prevent delivery of all messages that are exchanged on untrustworthy channels and feed in his own messages as he pleases.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>2.4 </dt>
<dd>Trustworthy and untrustworthy system participants and communication channels</dd>
<dt>2.4.1 </dt>

<dt>2.6 </dt>
<dd>Requirement for the cryptographic protocol: universal verifiability</dd>

</dl>
<dt>2.7 </dt>
<dd>Requirements for the cryptographic protocol: preserving voting secrecy and excluding premature partial results</dd>
<dt>2.7.1 </dt>
<dd>It must be ensured that no attacker is able to breach voting secrecy or establish premature partial results unless he can control the voters or their user devices. </dd>
<dt>2.7.2 </dt>

</dd>
<dt>2.11 </dt>
<dd>Additional requirements for the soundness of the proofs</dd>
<dt>2.11.1 </dt>
<dd>The probability of an attacker being able to falsify a proof under Number 2.5 if he changes a partial vote, suppresses a partial vote or casts a vote in someone else’s name must not exceed 0.1%.</dd>
<dt>2.11.2 </dt>
<dd>The probability of an attacker being able to falsify a proof under Number 2.6 if he causes the calculated result to deviate by 0.1% from the correct result by altering and suppressing votes cast in conformity with the system or by entering votes not cast in conformity with the system may not exceed 1% per proposal, list or candidate selection.</dd>
<dt>2.11.3 </dt>
<dd>If the probability of an attacker being able to falsify a proof under Number 2.6 is not negligible in the cryptographic sense<sup><a href="#fn-d6e1622" id="fnbck-d6e1622">3</a></sup>, it must be possible to reduce the probability of success as desired by repeated tallying, by providing the auditors with an additional, independent proof under Number 2.6 for each count. </dd>
<dt>2.12 </dt>
<dd>Functional requirements for the voting process with implications for the cryptographic protocol</dd>
<dt>2.12.1 </dt>
<dd>Only one vote can be cast with the authentication credentials assigned to a voter.</dd>
<dt>2.12.2 </dt>
<dd>The person voting enters their vote on the user device.</dd>
<dt>2.12.3 </dt>
<dd>The person voting can change the vote up to the point of confirming the decision to cast it and can check the vote against a summary.</dd>
<dt>2.12.4 </dt>
<dd>After the person voting has had the opportunity to check the vote against the summary, he or she confirms on the user device that he or she wants to cast the vote as entered.</dd>
<dt>2.12.5 </dt>
<dd>The proofs of correct voting under Number 2.5 must be divided into at least two sequential items of proof. Any indication presented as an item of proof must make a genuine contribution to the soundness of the proof referred to in Number 2.5. </dd>
<dt>2.12.6 </dt>
<dd>The user device displays the first item of proof to the person voting after he or she has confirmed on the user device that he or she wants to cast the vote. </dd>
<dt>2.12.7 </dt>
<dd>The user device will not display the next item of proof to the voting person until the voting person has entered into the user device that the previous item of proof is correct.</dd>
<dt>2.12.8 </dt>
<dd>By confirming that the penultimate item of proof is correct, the voting person confirms his or her decision to cast the vote definitively. </dd>
<dt>2.12.9 </dt>
<dd>The group of control components registers the vote as having been cast in conformity with the system when it has received confirmation of the definitive decision to cast the vote. </dd>
<dt>2.12.10 </dt>
<dd>When the person voting has checked the last item of proof as being correct, the voting process is complete. The last item of proof should be made particularly easy to check, by limiting the check as far as possible to the correct display of a single code or other simple indication.</dd>
<dt>2.12.11 </dt>
<dd>If voting data are imported, a setup component or a print component must no longer be considered trustworthy from that point on.</dd>
<dt>2.13 </dt>
<dd>Requirements for the definition and description of the cryptographic protocol</dd>
<dt>2.13.1 </dt>
<dd>Wherever possible, building-blocks are used that are in widespread use worldwide and have been thoroughly scrutinised by experts. Standards, reference projects and academic publications can be used as a benchmark. Derogations and cases of doubt must be dealt with separately in the context of the risk assessment referred to in Article 4.</dd>
<dt>2.13.2 </dt>
<dd>Instructions must not be underspecified. Individual instructions must restrict the options for implementation to such a degree that any form of implementation that the instructions allow is also compliant with meeting the cryptographic protocol requirements.</dd>
<dt>2.13.3 </dt>
<dd>It may be assumed that trustworthy channels exist to distribute electronic certificates among system participants. Number 3.8 applies.</dd>
<dt>2.14 </dt>
<dd>Proofs of compliance with the cryptographic protocol requirements</dd>
<dt>2.14.1 </dt>
<dd>A symbolic and a cryptographic proof of compliance must demonstrate that the cryptographic protocol meets the requirements in Numbers 2.1–2.12. </dd>
<dt>2.14.2 </dt>
<dd>The proofs of compliance must directly refer to the protocol description that forms the basis for system development. </dd>
<dt>2.14.3 </dt>
<dd>The proofs of compliance relating to basic cryptographic components may be provided according to generally accepted security assumptions and constructions (e.g. «random oracle model», «decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption», «Fiat-Shamir heuristic»).</dd>

<div class="collapseable"> <dl>
<dt>3.1 </dt>
<dd>The operation of the set-up component and at least one control component in the group which contains part of the key for decrypting the votes is the direct responsibility of the canton and must take place within its infrastructure. Outsourcing to a private system operator is not permitted.</dd>
<dt>3.2 </dt>
<dd>Sufficient entropy must be ensured when selecting random values, in particular for set-up components and control components. </dd>
<dt>3.3 </dt>
<dd>Auditors must verify the proofs referred to in Number 2.6 at least once and must use a technical aid referred to in Number 2 for this purpose.</dd>
<dt>3.4 </dt>
<dd>The operational requirements for set-up components in accordance with Number 3 also apply to technical aids used by the auditors. Within the scope of their responsibility under cantonal law, the auditors may provide for derogations.</dd>
<dt>3.5 </dt>
<dd>With the exception of the components mentioned under Numbers 3.1 and 3.3, the canton may delegate the operation of any part of the system, including the control components and the print component, to private service providers. A private operator of the print component may only perform operational tasks that are required for preparation, packaging and delivery. </dd>
<dt>3.6 </dt>
<dd>Trustworthy components (set-up components, print components, auditors’ technical aids and control components) must be set up, updated, configured and secured in an observable process.</dd>
<dt>3.7 </dt>
<dd>Before installing software, all programs must be checked using an official and trustworthy reference to ensure that the files are the correct and unaltered version.</dd>
<dt>3.8 </dt>
<dd>When other system participants’ electronic certificates are installed, their authenticity must be ensured. To that end, there should be a manual process in which people transfer the electronic certificates from one machine to another via a physical data carrier in accordance with 3.13.</dd>
<dt>3.9 </dt>
<dd>The timing for updating all software of trustworthy components must be such that the expected benefits outweigh the potential hazards.</dd>
<dt>3.10 </dt>
<dd>Set-up components, print components and auditors’ technical aids that are involved in any way in the processing of critical data must be physically monitored during the entire computing time by two persons and until any critical data have been deleted or securely stored. At most, they may be interconnected by visible physical cables so that it is as evident as possible that no other machines can access them until the confidential data is destroyed.</dd>
<dt>3.11 </dt>
<dd>Trustworthy components may not be connected to the internet when installing or updating software.</dd>
<dt>3.12 </dt>
<dd>In principle, critical data must be destroyed after use. If there are good reasons, secure storage of the data carrier is also permitted as an alternative.</dd>
<dt>3.13 </dt>
<dd>Data exchange or storage media, such as USB flash drives, must be removed after the data has been uploaded to the trustworthy components and may only be reused before the data is destroyed if there was no critical data on the trustworthy component before the data was uploaded. </dd>
<dt><b> </b></dt>
<dd>
<b></b>Data exchange or storage media must be reformatted and any data on them must be destroyed before they are used with the aid of a component operated in accordance with the requirements for trustworthy components.</dd>
<dt>3.14 </dt>
<dd>Logical or physical access to trustworthy components or data carriers containing critical data must be impossible without another person becoming aware of it, for example by having to assist in granting access (strict two person principle). </dd>
<dt>3.15 </dt>
<dd>Success in gaining unauthorised access to a control component should not as far as possible give any advantage in an attempt to access another control component unnoticed. In addition to the requirements set out in Number 3, the following requirements apply in this respect:<dl>
<dt>– </dt>
<dd>If a person has physical or logical access to a control component, that person may not have access to any other control component.</dd>
<dt>– </dt>
<dd>The hardware, the operating systems and the monitoring systems for the control components should be as distinct as possible from each other.</dd>
<dt>– </dt>
<dd>The control components should be connected to different local networks.</dd>
<dt>– </dt>
<dd>A control component must take the form of a physical device. Virtualisation across multiple physical devices is not permitted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>3.16 </dt>
<dd>Control components must be designed to recognise unpermitted instances of access and to alert the persons responsible. The persons responsible should arrange external monitoring measures, such as the monitoring and the manipulation-resistant logging of network traffic or physical monitoring with cameras that are under their control. The persons responsible must be considered to be particularly trustworthy and reliable.</dd>
<dt>3.17 </dt>
<dd>Trustworthy components may perform only the intended operations. </dd>
<dt>3.18 </dt>
<dd>The software for the auditors’ technical aids must be obtained from a different system developer from the one who developed the main part of the software for the other system components. The publication of the software for the technical aid under a licence that meets the criteria for open source software<sup><a href="#fn-d6e1854" id="fnbck-d6e1854">4</a></sup> may justify an exception. If auditors use several technical aids, this provision applies to at least one of the technical aids.</dd>
<dt>3.19 </dt>
<dd>All procedures for dealing with trustworthy components must be documented in writing and in a manner that is easily understood by the persons concerned.</dd>
<dt>3.20 </dt>
<dd>Any access to and use of a trusted component or data carrier containing critical data must be logged.</dd>
