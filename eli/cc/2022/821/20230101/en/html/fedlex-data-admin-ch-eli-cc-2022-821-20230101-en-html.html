<p class="absatz "><sup>3</sup> Extraordinary loading cases are temporary combinations of actions, such as may arise in particular in an extraordinary flood situation, due to avalanches or debris flows, due to ice pressure or due to pore water pressure conditions as a result of the construction process or rapid drawdown. Under these loading cases, minor damage to the water retaining facility is permitted.</p>
<p class="absatz "><sup>4</sup> Extreme loading cases are in particular an extreme flood situation and earthquakes. Damage to the water retaining facility is permitted under these loading cases; however, these must not cause any uncontrolled, damage-causing water release from the reservoir.</p>
