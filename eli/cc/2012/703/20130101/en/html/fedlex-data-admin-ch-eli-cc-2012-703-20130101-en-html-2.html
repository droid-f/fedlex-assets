<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> Water retaining facilities must be designed, constructed and operated in accordance with the state of the art in science and technology so that their safety is guaranteed for all foreseeable operating and loading cases.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> For the purpose of specifying measures, special attention must be paid as far as possible to the economically viable utilisation of hydropower. Measures are specified by the supervisory authority in consultation with the owner of the facility and, insofar as the measures concerned are of a structural nature and no agreement can be reached with the owner of the facility, following consultation with recognised specialists in the engineering and energy industries.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> It must be possible to empty the reservoir in order to carry out inspections and maintenance operations and it must be possible to lower the level of water therein if there is any imminent threat. For this purpose, water retaining facilities must at least be equipped with a bottom outlet of adequate dimensions, or with bottom sluice gates of adequate dimensions. The Federal Council may permit exceptions for special categories of water retaining facilities.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> It must be possible to divert floods safely when the reservoir is filled to its maximum capacity.</p>

</h6>
<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> Any person wishing to construct or modify water retaining facilities requires planning approval from the relevant licensing authority.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Where the construction or modification of an installation has to be approved on the basis of other legal provisions, at the same time as the decision on approval in accordance with those legal provisions a decision shall be made on whether to grant planning approval under this Act.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Planning approval must be granted if the technical safety requirements are complied with.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> The application for planning approval must include all the information required to carry out the technical safety assessment.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> The supervisory authority examines the application. If the supervisory authority is not the licensing authority, it shall inform the latter of the result of its technical safety assessment. If deemed necessary for ensuring the technical safety of the installation, the supervisory authority shall specify conditions concerning its construction.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> When making its decision, the licensing authority considers the result of the technical safety assessment and the requested conditions for ensuring the technical safety of the installation.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> The licensing authority shall order special structural measures if these are required to protect the installation against acts of sabotage.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> During the construction phase, the supervisory authority shall verify whether the specified technical safety requirements are complied with.</p>

<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>maintain the water retaining facility properly, repair damage and rectify safety defects without delay;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>retrofit or modify the facility if the supervisory authority requires such action in order to rectify safety defects;</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>permit the installation and use of national monitoring and measurement systems, and grant inspection bodies access to such systems.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>4</sup> The supervisory authority shall evaluate the reports and verify whether the technical safety requirements have been complied with. It shall also carry out periodical inspections of the facility.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> If deemed necessary for ensuring the technical safety of the facility, the supervisory authority shall specify conditions for the continued operation of the facility.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> Water retaining facilities must be monitored and maintained until such time as they are no longer able to retain or confine water, mud and other materials. If there is no operator, the owner of the land shall be responsible for these obligations.</p>
