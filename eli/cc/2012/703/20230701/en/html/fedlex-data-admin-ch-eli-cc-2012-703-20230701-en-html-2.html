<p class="absatz "><sup>1</sup> Water retaining facilities must be designed, constructed and operated in accordance with the state of the art in science and technology so that their safety is guaranteed for all foreseeable operating and loading cases.</p>
<p class="absatz "><sup>2</sup> For the purpose of specifying measures, special attention must be paid as far as possible to the economically viable utilisation of hydropower. Measures are specified by the supervisory authority in consultation with the owner of the facility and, insofar as the measures concerned are of a structural nature and no agreement can be reached with the owner of the facility, following consultation with recognised specialists in the engineering and energy industries.</p>
<p class="absatz "><sup>3</sup> It must be possible to empty the reservoir in order to carry out inspections and maintenance operations and it must be possible to lower the level of water therein if there is any imminent threat. For this purpose, water retaining facilities must at least be equipped with a bottom outlet of adequate dimensions, or with bottom sluice gates of adequate dimensions. The Federal Council may permit exceptions for special categories of water retaining facilities.</p>
<p class="absatz "><sup>4</sup> It must be possible to divert floods safely when the reservoir is filled to its maximum capacity.</p>
