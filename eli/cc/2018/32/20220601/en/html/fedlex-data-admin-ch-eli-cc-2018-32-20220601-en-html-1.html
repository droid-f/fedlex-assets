<dt>42. </dt>
<dd>
<i>AAA (authentication, authorisation and accounting) information: </i>information on which subscribers are allowed to use which services and which is used to bill subscribers for service usage. For the purposes of this Ordinance, passwords are not regarded as AAA information. Authentication is the process by which a subscriber is identified before the access is granted. Authorisation determines which rights of access to resources or services that a subscriber holds and also guarantees access control. The subscriber’s use of resources is measured for accounting purposes;</dd>

There are also extensions for various types of media and services, such as SMS, email, fax or video messages as well as function extensions such as converting from one type of media to another and the sending of messages;</dd>
<dt>45. </dt>
<dd>
<i>RCS (Rich Communications Services):</i> (originally: Rich Communication Suite) specification of the international industry organisation for mobile telephony providers (GSM Association, GSMA) for the IMS based provision of interoperable (i.e. cross-provider and cross-terminal) multimedia services with extended functional scope.
