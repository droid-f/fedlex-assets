<dd>equity securities of companies with registered office in Switzerland are traded at such trading venues or if such trading venues facilitate the trading of such equity securities; and</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>the equity securities pursuant to letter a are listed at a stock exchange in Switzerland or are traded at a trading venue in Switzerland.</dd>

<p class="absatz "><sup>2</sup> A foreign stock exchange does not require recognition for the trading of certain equity securities pursuant to paragraph 1 if:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>the equity securities are admitted to trading or are listed at the foreign stock exchange with the express consent of the issuer of the equity securities, which must have been given prior to 30 November 2018;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>the equity securities were admitted to trading or were listed at the foreign stock exchange before 30 November 2018; and</dd>
