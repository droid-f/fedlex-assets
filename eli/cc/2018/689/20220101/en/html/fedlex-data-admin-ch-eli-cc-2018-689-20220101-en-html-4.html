</h6>
<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> In addition to and irrespective of the duty to obtain recognition pursuant to Article 41 of the Financial Market Infrastructure Act of 19 June 2015<sup><a href="#fn-d6e47" id="fnbck-d6e47">2</a></sup> (FinMIA), from 1 January 2019 trading venues with registered office abroad must also obtain prior recognition from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) if:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>equity securities of companies with registered office in Switzerland are traded at such trading venues or if such trading venues facilitate the trading of such equity securities; and</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>the equity securities pursuant to letter a are listed at a stock exchange in Switzerland or are traded at a trading venue in Switzerland.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>2</sup> A foreign stock exchange does not require recognition for the trading of certain equity securities pursuant to paragraph 1 if:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>the equity securities are admitted to trading or are listed at the foreign stock exchange with the express consent of the issuer of the equity securities, which must have been given prior to 30 November 2018;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>the equity securities were admitted to trading or were listed at the foreign stock exchange before 30 November 2018; and</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>the issuer of the equity securities accepts responsibility for the duties associated with the admission to trading or listing at the foreign stock exchange.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>3</sup> The recognition of a foreign trading venue ceases once that foreign trading venue has its registered office in a jurisdiction listed in accordance with Article 3 paragraph 3.</p>

<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> FINMA shall grant recognition on request if the foreign trading venue:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>is subject to appropriate regulation and supervision; and</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>does not have its registered office in a jurisdiction that restricts its market participants in trading equity securities of companies with registered office in Switzerland at Swiss trading venues and thereby significantly adversely affects the trading in such equity securities at Swiss trading venues.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>2</sup> FINMA may also grant recognition to a foreign trading venue without being requested to do so if that foreign trading venue fulfils the requirements of paragraph 1.</p>
