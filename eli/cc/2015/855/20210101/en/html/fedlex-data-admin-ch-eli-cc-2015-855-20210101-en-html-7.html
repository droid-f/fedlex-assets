<p><sup>3</sup> If a threshold is reached, exceeded or fallen below of as a result of a company with registered office in Switzerland increasing, decreasing of restructuring its share capital, the notification duty is triggered by the correspondent publication in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce. In the case of companies with registered office abroad whose equity securities are mainly listed in whole or in part in Switzerland the notification duty is triggered by the publication in accordance with Article 115 paragraph 3 FinMIO.</p>
