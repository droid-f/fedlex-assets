<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> In addition to the information system under Article 60, the FOPH shall operate a proximity tracing system for the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus (PT System). The PT System records encounters between mobile telephones of persons that participate in the system, and notifies them if they have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The PT System and the data that it processes serve to notify the persons under paragraph 1 and produce statistics on the PT System. The PT System and the data must not be used for other purposes, in particular by cantonal authorities to order or enforce measures under Articles 33–38 or by the police or the prosecution or intelligence services.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Participation in the PT System is voluntary for everyone. Authorities, businesses and individuals may not give preference to or discriminate against any person based on their participation or non-participation in the PT System; any agreements to the contrary shall be invalid.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Any person who has been notified by the PT System that they have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus shall be entitled, on providing proof of notification, to be tested free of charge for infection with the coronavirus and for antibodies against the coronavirus.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> The PT System shall be designed according to the following principles:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>In relation to data processing, all appropriate technical and organisational measures must be taken to make it impossible to identify the participants.</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>The data shall as far as possible be processed on decentralised components installed by the participants on their mobile telephones. In particular, data recorded on a participant's mobile telephone relating to other persons shall be processed and stored exclusively on that mobile telephone.</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>The only data collected or processed in any other manner shall be data required to determine the distance and time of encounters and to issue the notifications; the data do not include location data.</dd>
<dt>d. </dt>
<dd>The data shall be destroyed as soon as they are no longer required for the notification.</dd>
<dt>e. </dt>
<dd>The source code and the technical specifications of all components of the PT System shall be made public. It must be evident that the machine-readable programmes were produced using this source code.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>6</sup> The federal legislation on data protection applies.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> The Federal Council shall regulate the details on organising and operating the PT System and on processing the data.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> The Federal Council shall provide for the PT System to be terminated, and in particular for the deactivation or deinstallation of all components installed on mobile telephones, as soon as the PT System is no longer required to manage the epidemic caused by the coronavirus or if it proves to be insufficiently effective.</p>
