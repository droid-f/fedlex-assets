</h6>
<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> The cantonal authority establishes whether the future adoptive parents are suitable with regard to the best interests and needs of the child to be placed.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> A person is suitable if:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>the entire circumstances, and in particular the motives of the future adoptive parents, lead to the expectation that the adoption will be in the best interests of the child;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>

<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>there are no legal obstacles to the adoption;</dd>

<dt>1. </dt>
<dd>offer a guarantee in terms of their personality, health, available time, financial circumstances and educational suitability as well as their living conditions for the good care, upbringing and education of the child,</dd>
<dt>2. </dt>
<dd>are prepared to accept the child as he or she is, to respect his or her origins, and to familiarise the child in a suitable way according to his or her needs with the country where he or she was habitually resident before placement (country of origin),</dd>
<dt>3. </dt>
<dd>have not been convicted of an offence that is incompatible with adoption,</dd>
<dt>4. </dt>
<dd>have prepared sufficiently for the adoption, and in particular have attended suitable preparatory or informative events recommended by the cantonal authority,</dd>
<dt>5. </dt>
<dd>have declared in writing that they will cooperate in the preparation of post-adoption reports for the attention of the country of origin,</dd>
<dt>6. </dt>
<dd>have acknowledged their maintenance obligation contained in Article 20 HCAA.</dd>

<p><sup>3</sup> Stricter requirements must be imposed on the suitability of the future adoptive parents when placing a child over 4 years of age or a child with health issues or of two or more children are placed at the same time or there are already two or more children in the family.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Parents may not be deemed suitable if the age difference between the child to be placed and the future adoptive parents amounts to more than 45 years. By way of exception, the parents may nevertheless be deemed suitable, particularly if an intimate relationship already exists between the future adoptive parents and the child to be placed.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> The cantonal authority appoints a person to assess the case who is professionally qualified in social work or psychology and who has professional experience in child protection or adoption matters.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> In order to confirm compliance with paragraph 2 letter d number 3, the cantonal authority requests an extract from the register of criminal convictions information system (VOSTRA). In the case of foreign nationals, it requests an extract from the register of criminal convictions in their country of origin or an equivalent document. If criminal proceedings are pending in connection with an offence which is incompatible with adoption, the cantonal authority suspends the assessment of suitability until the criminal proceedings have been finally concluded.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> The authorisation contains in particular details of the name and the date and place of birth of the child. It may be made subject to requirements and conditions.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> In the case of international adoptions, the cantonal authority decides before the entry of the child whether authorisation is to be granted. In justified exceptional cases, it may agree to entry before it decides on whether to grant authorisation, in particular if it is impossible or unreasonable to meet the demand that the documents under paragraph 1 letters b–e be submitted before entry.</p>
