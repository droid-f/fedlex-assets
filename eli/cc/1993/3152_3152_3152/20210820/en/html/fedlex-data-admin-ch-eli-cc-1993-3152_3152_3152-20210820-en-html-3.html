</dl>
<p>Section 6 Significant Changes to the Contract</p>
<p><b>Art. 8</b><b> </b>Definition</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Any significant change of an essential contract term by the organiser before the start of the journey is considered an essential change to the contract itself.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> A price increase exceeding ten percent is considered an essential change to the contract.</p>
<p><b>Art. 9</b><b> </b>Obligation to inform</p>
<p>The organiser shall notify the consumer as quickly as possible of any essential change to the contract as well as its effects on the total package price.</p>
<p><b>Art. 10</b> Consumer rights</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The consumer may accept an essential change to the contract or withdraw from the contract without penalty.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> He must give notice of his withdrawal from the contract to the organiser or the retailer as soon as possible.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> If the consumer withdraws from the contract he or she is entitled to either:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>take a substitute package of equivalent or higher quality where the organiser or retailer is able to offer him such a substitute;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>

<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>be repaid all sums paid by him under the contract in the quickest possible manner.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>4</sup> A claim for damages due to non-performance of the contract remains reserved.</p>
<p>Section 7 Cancellation of the Package</p>
<p><b>Art. 11</b></p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Where, for whatever cause not imputable to the consumer, the organiser cancels the package before the agreed date of departure, the consumer is entitled to the rights under Article 10.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The consumer is not, however, entitled to claim for damages for non-performance of the contract:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>if the cancellation is on the grounds that the number of persons enrolled for the package is less than the minimum number required and the consumer is informed of the cancellation, in writing, within the period indicated in the contract; or</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>if the cancellation is due to force majeure. Overbooking is not considered a case of force majeure.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Section 8<br>Non-Performance and Improper Performance of the Contract</p>
<p><b>Art. 12</b><b> </b>Complaints</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The consumer must communicate any failure in the performance of the contract which he or she perceives on the spot to the supplier of the services concerned and to the organiser or the retailer in writing or any other appropriate form at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> In cases of complaint, the organiser, the retailer or his local representative must make prompt efforts to find appropriate solutions.</p>
<p><b>Art. 13</b><b> </b>Alternative arrangements</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Where, after departure, a significant proportion of the services contracted for is not provided or the organiser perceives that it will be unable to procure a significant proportion of the services to be provided, the organiser shall:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>make suitable alternative arrangements for the continuation of the package;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>compensate the consumer for the loss suffered; the quantum of damages corresponds to the difference between the services offered and those supplied.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>2</sup> If it is impossible to make such arrangements or these are not accepted by the consumer for good reasons, the organiser must provide the consumer with equivalent transport back to the place of departure, or to another return-point to which the consumer has agreed.<sup><a href="#fn-d2396e473">6</a></sup> In addition, the organiser must compensate the consumer for the loss suffered therefrom.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> The measures under this Article do not justify any extra charge to the consumer.</p>
<p><b>Art. 14</b><b> </b>Liability; Principle</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The organiser or the retailer party to the contract is liable to the consumer for the proper performance of the obligations arising from the contract, irrespective of whether such obligations must be performed by that organiser or retailer himself or by other suppliers of services.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The organiser and the retailer have a right of recourse against other suppliers of services.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> In the matter of damages arising from the non-performance or improper performance of the contract, the limits of compensation provided for in international conventions remain reserved.</p>
<p><b>Art. 15</b><b> </b>Exceptions</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The organiser or the retailer are not liable to the consumer where the non-performance or improper performance of the contract is due to:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>failures attributable to the consumer;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>unforeseeable or unavoidable failures attributable to a third party unconnected with the provision of the services contracted for;</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>a case of force majeure or an event which the organiser, the retailer or the supplier of services, even with all due care, could not foresee or forestall.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>2</sup> In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 letter b, the organiser or the retailer party to the contract is required to give prompt assistance to a consumer in difficulty.</p>
<p><b>Art. 16</b><b> </b>Limitation and exclusion of liability</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Any limitation of liability by means of a contractual clause for personal injury arising from the non-performance or improper performance of the contract is excluded.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> In the matter of other damages, liability may be reduced to double the amount of the total price of the package by means of a contractual clause, save for damages caused wilfully or through gross negligence.</p>
<p>Section 9 Assignment of the Booking</p>
<p><b>Art. 17</b></p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Where the consumer is prevented from proceeding with the package, he or she may assign his or her booking to a person who satisfies all the conditions applicable to the package, provided that he or she has first given the organiser or the retailer reasonable notice of his or her intention before departure.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> This person and the consumer shall be jointly and severally liable to the organiser or the retailer party to the contract for payment of the price and for any additional costs arising from such transfer.</p>
<p>Section 10 Security</p>
<p><b>Art. 18</b></p>
<p><sup>1</sup> The organiser or the retailer party to the contract shall provide security for the refund of money paid over and for the repatriation of the consumer in the event of their insolvency or bankruptcy.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> On request, the organiser or the retailer must provide evidence of the security to the consumer. If it fails to do so, the consumer may withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> The withdrawal must be communicated to the organiser or the retailer in writing before the departure date.</p>
<p>Section 11 Mandatory Law</p>
<p><b>Art. 19</b></p>
<p>Any deviation from this Act to the disadvantage of the consumer is prohibited unless explicitly provided for therein.</p>
<p>Section 12 Referendum and Commencement</p>
