<p><sup>3 </sup>In derogation from the principle laid down in Article 3 letter c, it may authorise feed additives and technical aids which have been produced using genetically modified organisms if:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>they cannot be replaced by other substances; and</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>they are not available on the market manufactured in any other way.<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e1495">83</a></sup>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>4 </sup>The purchase of feedingstuffs to supplement the holding’s own feed stocks is permitted. Purchases must be from organically produced crops and if possible from the same region. For the purposes of harmonisation with the relevant EU legislation, the Department may make provision that a limited percentage of non-organic animal feedingstuffs may be purchased.<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e1507">84</a></sup></p>
<p><sup>5 </sup>The addition of feedingstuffs from conversion holdings is permitted on average up to a maximum of 30 per cent of the ration of individual categories of production animal, as dry matter. If this feedingstuff is from the holding itself, the amount may be 60 per cent, and, where this is a conversion holding, 100 per cent.<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e1519">85</a></sup></p>
<p><sup>6</sup> In case of proven fodder yield losses, especially due to exceptional weather conditions, the directly affected livestock farmer may use non-organic fodder for a limited period with the prior written agreement of the certification body, provided that the livestock farmer is able to satisfy the certification body that insufficient organic fodder is available. If whole areas are affected by fodder yield losses, FOAG may also grant permission for the area.<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e1531">86</a></sup></p>
<p><sup>7</sup> Fodder ingredients must be left natural and fodder preparation methods used must be as natural and energy-saving as possible. Feedingstuffs may not contain any traces of genetically modified organisms or of secondary products of genetically modified organisms which proportionally are higher than the maximum levels for unavoidable impurities laid down in legislation on feedingstuffs.</p>
<p>8 Animals in nomadic herds and animals put out to summer pasture may temporarily graze on non-organically farmed areas. The amount of fodder consumed, as dry matter, may not exceed 10 per cent of the total annual fodder intake.<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e1545">87</a></sup></p>
<p>9 The proportion of non-organically grown fodder may amount to 10 per cent of the total fodder consumption for retired horses.<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e1556">88</a></sup></p>

</dl>
<p>2 If an animal becomes sick or injured, it must be treated immediately, if necessary in isolation, and in suitable housing.</p>
<p>3 The use of veterinary medicinal products in organic stockfarming shall comply with the following principles:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>Phytotherapeutic products (e.g. plant extracts, excluding antibiotics, or plant essences), homeopathic products (e.g. plant, animal and mineral substances) and trace elements and products laid down by the Department for this purpose shall be used in preference to chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics, provided that their therapeutic effect is shown to be effective for the species of animal and the condition for which the treatment is intended. </dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>If the use of the products listed in letter a should not prove to be effective in combating illness or injury, but treatment is essential to prevent suffering or distress to the animal, chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics may be used under the responsibility of a veterinarian.</dd>

<dt>d.</dt>
<dd>The use of chemically-synthesised allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics for preventive treatments is not permitted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>4 The type of product (including an indication of the active pharmacological substances involved) together with details of the diagnosis, the method of administration, the duration of the treatment and the prescribed withdrawal period must be recorded clearly and indelibly in writing in the treatment book.</p>
<p>5 Livestock treated must be clearly identified as such at all times – individually in the case of large animals, individually or as a group, in the case of poultry or small animals.</p>
<p>6 Vaccination and worming is permitted where there is an existing animal health risk.</p>

<div class="collapseable"> <p>1 For imports, a certificate of inspection must be issued in the EU system for the electronic certification of the import of organic products (Traces) in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1235/2008<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e2861">149</a></sup>. Where a consignment is to be split into several batches before assessment, an extract from the certificate of inspection in Traces must be issued for each batch resulting from the split.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Switzerland uses the EU’s Traces information system. </p>
<p><sup>3</sup> FOAG shall grant certification bodies and operators in Switzerland access rights to Traces. It bases its decision on the check that the certification bodies have carried out in relation to the identity of the operators that they have under contract. It may grant access rights to Traces to other federal and cantonal authorities if this is required to fulfil its duties.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> In cases in which the Traces information system does not work, certificates of inspection and extracts from certificates of inspection may be issued and endorsed without using Traces.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> The EAER shall regulate the certificates of inspection and extracts from certificates of inspection in Traces as well as the procedures.<sup><a href="#fn-d167727e2878">150</a></sup></p>
