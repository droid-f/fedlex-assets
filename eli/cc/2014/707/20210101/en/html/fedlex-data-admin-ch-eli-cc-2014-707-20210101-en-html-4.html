</h6>
<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> To establish the overall exposure of a securities fund using commitment approach II, the fund management company shall determine the individual conversion amounts of the respective derivatives and derivative components as well as the conversion amounts arising from investment techniques.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> In the case of basic types of derivatives, the conversion amount for the overall exposure arising from derivatives is normally the underlying equivalent, based on the market value of the underlying assets of the derivatives. The underlying equivalents are calculated in accordance with Annex 1. The nominal value or the forward price of futures contracts calculated on each trading day may be taken as the basis, if the result is a more conservative calculation.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> The conversion amount for the overall exposure is the basic commitment from the net fund assets and the sum of the following absolute values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>conversion amounts of the individual derivatives and derivative components pursuant to Annex 1 that are not included in netting pursuant to Article 36;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>conversion amounts after permitted netting pursuant to Article 36; and</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>conversion amounts from permitted investment techniques.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>4</sup> The following transactions may be disregarded when determining the conversion amount for the overall exposure arising from derivatives pursuant to paragraph 3:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>swaps by means of which the performance of the underlyings directly held by the securities fund is swapped with the performance of other underlyings (total return swaps), provided that:<dl>
<dt>1. </dt>
<dd>the market risk of the swapped underlyings is completely eliminated from the securities fund so that these assets have no impact on the change in the value of the securities fund, and </dd>
<dt>2. </dt>
<dd>the swap does not grant option rights or contain leverage or other additional market risks that exceed those of a direct investment in the relevant underlyings;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>derivatives to which corresponding highly liquid assets are assigned so that the combination of derivative and highly liquid assets is equivalent to a direct investment in the underlying asset and neither an additional market risk nor leverage is generated. The highly liquid assets used to cover the derivative position may not be used for more than one combination simultaneously.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>5</sup> Securities lending and repurchase transactions must be taken into account when calculating the overall exposure if these generate leverage on the fund assets through the reinvestment of collateral. Where collateral is reinvested in financial assets that provide a return in excess of the risk-free interest rate, the amount received must be included when determining the overall exposure if cash collateral is held.</p>

<dd>the conversion amount of the derivatives is determined pursuant to Article 35.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>2</sup> If the derivatives in hedging transactions do not relate to the same underlying as the asset that is to be hedged, the following additional conditions must be met for netting:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>The derivative transaction is not based on an investment strategy that serves to generate a profit.</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>The derivative results in a demonstrable reduction in the risk of the securities fund.</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>

<dt>d. </dt>
<dd>The derivatives, underlyings or assets that are to be netted relate to the same class of financial instruments.</dd>
<dt>e. </dt>
<dd>The hedging strategy remains effective even under exceptional market conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>3</sup> Where interest rate derivatives are predominantly used, the amount to be included in the overall exposure arising from derivatives can be determined using internationally recognised duration-netting rules provided that:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>the rules result in a correct determination of the risk profile of the securities fund; </dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>the material risks are taken into account;</dd>

<dd>the leverage of the securities fund is not increased either by applying these rules or through investments in short-term positions.</dd>
