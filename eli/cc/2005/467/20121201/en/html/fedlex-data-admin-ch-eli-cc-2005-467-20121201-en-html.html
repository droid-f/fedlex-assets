<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>Amendments to the study plan should be justified and approved by dated signature of the Study Director and maintained with the study plan.</dd>

</h4>
<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> A unique identification should be given to each study. All items concerning this study should carry this identification. Specimens from the study should be identified to confirm their origin. Such identification should enable traceability, as appropriate for the specimen and study.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The study should be conducted in accordance with the study plan.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> All data generated during the conduct of the study should be recorded directly, promptly, accurately, and legibly by the individual entering the data. These entries should be signed or initialled and dated.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Any change in the raw data should be made so as not to obscure the previous entry, should indicate the reason for change and should be dated and signed or initialled by the individual making the change.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Data generated as a direct computer input should be identified at the time of data input by the individual(s) responsible for direct data entries. Computerised system design should always provide for the retention of full audit trails to show all changes to the data without obscuring the original data. It should be possible to associate all changes to data with the persons having made those changes, for example, by use of timed and dated (electronic) signatures. Reason for changes should be given.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In the absence of a required retention period, the final disposal of any study materials should be documented. When samples of test and reference items and specimens are disposed of before the expiry of the required retention period for any reason, this should be justified and documented. Samples of test and reference items and specimens should be retained only as long as the quality of the preparation permits evaluation.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Material retained in the archives should be indexed so as to facilitate orderly storage and retrieval.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Only personnel authorised by management should have access to the archives. Movement of material in and out of the archives should be properly recorded.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> If a test facility or an archive contracting facility goes out of business and has no legal successor, the archive should be transferred to the archives of the sponsor(s) of the study(s).</p>
