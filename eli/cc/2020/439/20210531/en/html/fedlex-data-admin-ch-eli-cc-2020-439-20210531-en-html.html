<p><sup>  3</sup> In order to achieve effective protection in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, the operator or organiser shall if necessary take different measures for individual areas of the establishment business or event, for example for seating or catering areas, or for individual groups of persons, for example, by forming permanent teams.</p>
<p>1.3 Reason for recording contact details</p>
<p>  If provision must be made in the precautionary measures plan in accordance with Article 4 paragraph 2 letter d for recording contact details, the reasons for doing so must be stated in the plan.</p>
