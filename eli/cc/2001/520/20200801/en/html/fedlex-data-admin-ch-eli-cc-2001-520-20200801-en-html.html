<div class="collapseable"> <p><sup>1</sup> Medical devices are instruments, apparatus, appliances, software, materials, accessories or other medical technology articles, whether used alone or in combination, including the software intended to be used specifically for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes and necessary for the proper application of a medical device:</p>

<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>that are intended for use on human beings;</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>that do not achieve their principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which action can be assisted by such means; and</dd>

<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>in vitro diagnostic medical devices;</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>active implantable medical devices.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>3</sup> In vitro diagnostic medical devices are medical devices which are used as a reagent, reagent product, calibrator, control material, kit, instrument, apparatus, equipment or system in accordance with their specified purpose for the in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body, including blood and tissue donations, and which are used solely or principally for the purpose of providing information:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>on physiological or pathological states;</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>on congenital abnormalities;</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
<dd>to determine safety and compatibility with potential recipients;</dd>
<dt>d.</dt>
<dd>to monitor therapeutic measures.</dd>
</dl>
<p><sup>4</sup> Active implantable medical devices are medical devices:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>which rely for their functioning on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity;</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>which are intended to be totally or partially introduced into the human body by means of a surgical or medical intervention or into a natural orifice by means of a medical intervention; and</dd>
<dt>c.</dt>
