The objection has no suspensive effect. If the council president holds that the ruling is unlawful or unreasonable, he or she may award the person making the objection compensation in satisfaction. The decision on the objection is final.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> Before the supervisory committees question a member of the Federal Council, they shall inform him or her of the subject matter of the questions. They shall inform the Federal Council prior to questioning persons who are or have been subordinated to it. They shall consult with the Federal Council at its request before persons are required to provide information or hand over documents.</p>
