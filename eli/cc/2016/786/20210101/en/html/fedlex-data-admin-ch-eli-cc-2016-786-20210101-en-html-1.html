<dt>1. </dt>
<dd>In addition to the alternative procedure set out in the CRS or in an applicable agreement for financial accounts of individuals who are beneficiaries of a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract, the following provisions apply:</dd>
<dt><i> </i></dt>
<dd>
<i>«A reporting financial institution may treat a financial account that is a member's interest in a group cash value insurance contract or group annuity contract as a financial account that is not a reportable account until the date on which an amount is payable to the employee/certificate holder or beneficiary, if the financial account that is a member's interest in a group cash value insurance contract or group annuity contract meets the following requirements:</i><dl>
<dt><i>a) </i></dt>
<dd><i>the group cash value insurance contract or group annuity insurance contract is issued to an employer and covers 25 or more employees/certificate holders;</i></dd>
<dt><i>b) </i></dt>
<dd><i>the employees/certificate holders are entitled to receive any contract value related to their interest and to name beneficiaries for the benefit payable upon the employee's death; and</i></dd>
<dt><i>c) </i></dt>
<dd><i>the aggregate amount payable to any employee/certificate holder or beneficiary does not exceed USD 1,000,000.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><i> </i></dt>
<dd><i>The term «group cash value insurance contract» means a cash value insurance contract that (i) provides cover for individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union or other association or group, and (ii) charges a premium for each member of the group (or member of a class within the group) that is determined without regard to the individual health characteristics other than age, gender and smoking habits of the member (or class of members) of the group.</i></dd>
<dt><i> </i></dt>
<dd><i>The term «group annuity insurance contract» means an annuity insurance contract under which the obligees are individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group.»</i></dd>
<dt>2. </dt>
<dd>Instead of the definition given for «preexisting account» in the CRS or in an applicable agreement, the following applies:</dd>
<dt><i> </i></dt>
<dd>
<i>«The term «preexisting account» means:</i><dl>
<dt><i>a) </i></dt>
<dd><i>a financial account maintained by a reporting financial institution as at [xx.xx.xxxx];</i></dd>
<dt><i>b) </i></dt>
<dd>
<i>any financial account of an account holder, regardless of the date such financial account was opened, if:</i><dl>
<dt><i>i. </i></dt>
<dd><i>the account holder also holds with the reporting financial institution (or with a related entity within the same jurisdiction as the reporting financial institution) a financial account that is a preexisting account under subparagraph C(9)(a),</i></dd>
<dt><i>ii. </i></dt>
<dd><i>the reporting financial institution (and, as applicable, the related entity within the same jurisdiction as the reporting financial institution) treats both of the aforementioned financial accounts, and any other financial accounts of the account holder that are treated as preexisting accounts under letter b, as a single financial account for the purposes of satisfying the standards of knowledge requirements set forth in paragraph A of Section VII and for the purposes of determining the balance or value of any of the financial accounts when applying any of the account thresholds,</i></dd>
<dt><i>iii. </i></dt>
<dd><i>with respect to a financial account that is subject to AML/KYC procedures, the reporting financial institution is permitted to satisfy such AML/KYC procedures for the financial account by relying upon the AML/KYC procedures performed for the preexisting account described in subparagraph C(9)(a), and</i></dd>
<dt><i>iv. </i></dt>
<dd><i>the opening of the financial account does not require the provision of new, additional or amended client information by the account holder other than for purposes of the common reporting standard.»</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>3. </dt>
<dd>Instead of the definition given for «related entity» in the CRS or in an applicable agreement, the following applies:</dd>
<dt><i> </i></dt>
<dd><i>«An entity is a «related entity» of another entity if (a) either entity controls the other entity; (b) the two entities are under common control; or (c) the two entities are investment entities as described in subparagraph A(6)(b), are under common management, and such management fulfils the due diligence obligations of such investment entities. For this purpose, control includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the votes and value in an entity.»</i></dd>
