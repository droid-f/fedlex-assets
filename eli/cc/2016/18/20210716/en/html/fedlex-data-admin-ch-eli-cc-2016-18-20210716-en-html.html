</h3>
<div class="collapseable"> <p><b>1</b>  The type examination is the part of the conformity assessment procedure in which a conformity assessment body examines the technical design of an apparatus and certifies that it satisfies the essential requirements of this Ordinance.</p>
<p><b>2</b>  A type examination is carried out by assessing the adequacy of the technical design of the apparatus through examination of the technical documentation referred to in point 3, without examination of a specimen (design type). It may be restricted to some aspects of the essential requirements as specified by the manufacturer or its authorised representative.</p>
<p><b>3  Request for a type examination</b></p>
<p>3.1 The request for a type examination must be submitted by the manufacturer to a single conformity assessment body of its choice. </p>
<p>3.2 The request shall specify the aspects of the essential requirements for which examination is requested and shall include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>a. </dt>
<dd>the name and address of the manufacturer and, if the request is submitted by the authorised representative, the agent’s name and address as well;</dd>
<dt>b. </dt>
<dd>a written declaration that same request has not been submitted to any other conformity assessment body;</dd>
<dt>c. </dt>
<dd>the technical documentation referred to in Article 10. </dd>
</dl>
<p><b>4</b>  The conformity assessment body shall examine the technical documentation to assess the adequacy of the technical design of the apparatus in relation to the aspects of the essential requirements for which examination is requested.</p>
<p><b>5</b>  The conformity assessment body shall issue an evaluation report that records the activities undertaken in accordance with point 4 and their outcomes. Without prejudice to its obligations vis-à-vis OFCOM, the conformity assessment body shall release the content of that report, in full or in part, only with the agreement of the manufacturer.</p>
<p><b>6  Type examination certificate</b></p>
<p>6.1 Where the type meets the requirements of this Ordinance that apply to the apparatus concerned, the conformity assessment body shall issue a type examination certificate to the manufacturer. The certificate shall contain the name and address of the manufacturer, the conclusions of the examination, the aspects of the essential requirements covered by the examination, the conditions (if any) for its validity and the necessary data for identification of the approved type. The type examination certificate may have one or more annexes attached</p>
<p>6.2 The type examination certificate and its annexes shall contain all relevant information to allow the conformity of manufactured apparatus with the examined type to be evaluated and to allow for in-service control.</p>
<p>6.3 Where the type does not satisfy the applicable requirements of this Ordinance, the conformity assessment body shall refuse to issue a type examination certificate and shall inform the applicant accordingly, giving detailed reasons for its refusal</p>
<p><b>7  Obligations to take action</b></p>
<p>7.1 The conformity assessment body shall keep itself apprised of any changes in the generally acknowledged state of the art; if there is any indication that the approved type may no longer comply with the applicable requirements of this Ordinance, it shall determine whether such changes require further investigation. If so, the conformity assessment body shall inform the manufacturer accordingly</p>
<p>7.2 The manufacturer shall inform the conformity assessment body that holds the technical documentation relating to the type examination certificate of any modifications to the approved type that may affect the conformity of the apparatus with the essential requirements of this Ordinance or the conditions for the validity of the certificate. Such modifications shall require additional approval in the form of an addition to the original type examination certificate</p>
<p><b>8  Obligations to provide information</b></p>
<p>8.1 Each conformity assessment body shall inform OFCOM of the type examination certificates and/or any additions thereto that it has issued or withdrawn and shall provide OFCOM periodically or on request with a list of certificates and/or additions thereto to that it has refused, suspended or otherwise restricted in any other way.</p>
<p>8.2 Each conformity assessment body shall inform the other conformity assessment bodies of any type examination certificates and/or any additions thereto that it has refused, suspended or otherwise restricted in any other way, and shall notify them on request of any such certificates and/or additions thereto that it has issued.</p>
<p>8.3 OFCOM and the other conformity assessment bodies may, on request, obtain a copy of the type examination certificates and/or additions thereto. OFCOM shall on request be provided with a copy of the technical documentation and the results of the examinations carried out by the conformity assessment body. The conformity assessment body shall keep a copy of the type examination certificate, its annexes and additions, as well as the technical file including the documentation submitted by the manufacturer, until the expiry of the validity of that certificate.</p>
<p><b>9</b>  The manufacturer shall retain a copy of the type examination certificate, its annexes and additions and the technical documentation for ten years after the apparatus has been placed on the market of the apparatus for submission to OFCOM.</p>
<p><b>10</b>  The manufacturer’s authorised representative may submit the request referred to in point 3 and fulfil the obligations set out in points 7 and 9, provided they are specified in a mandate.</p>
