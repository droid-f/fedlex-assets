<dd><b>Manufacturing</b></dd>
<dt>2.1 </dt>
<dd>The manufacturer shall operate an approved quality system for the design, manufacture, final radio equipment inspection and testing of the radio equipment concerned as specified in point 3 and shall be subject to monitoring as specified in point 4.</dd>
<dt>2.2 </dt>
<dd>The manufacturer shall take appropriate account of changes to the design of the radio equipment or in its characteristics and changes in the harmonised standards or other technical specifications <span style="color: #000000;">by reference to which conformity of radio equipment is declared</span>.</dd>
