# Fedlex assets
This is a complementary repository to the [Fedlex metadata](https://github.com/droid-f/fedlex) repository. Here are collected and stored the ``HTML`` manifestations of the works presented in the federal law portal Fedlex. At this time the Federal Chancellery produces ``HTML`` manifestation for _Classified Compilation_ products[^1] only.

- Data is provided _as is_, objects are updated and committed to this repository several times each day. Files are stored according to their ``URI``'s path. 
- Images and additional assets referenced in the ``HTML`` files are not included. 

Note that changes to a consolidated version are presented with a new name with the suffix ``-1``, ``-2``, etc. As a consequence, there is no real use of git. This could change in future.
